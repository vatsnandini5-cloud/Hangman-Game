🎮 Hangman Game
🏆 CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship – Task 1
📌 Introduction

This project is my submission for Task 1 – Hangman Game under the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.
The goal of the task is to build a simple text-based Hangman Game using only core Python concepts.

🎯 Task Requirements (As per CodeAlpha PDF)

Use a small predefined word list

Limit incorrect guesses to 6

No file or API usage

Basic console input/output

Use: random, loops, if-else, strings, lists

🧠 Features

Random word selection 🎲

Masked display (_ _ _ _)

Single-letter guessing 🔡

Tracks correct & incorrect attempts ❌

Prevents repeated guesses

Win/Loss detection 🏆💀

Clean console interaction

🔧 Technologies Used

Python 3

Built-in random module

Console-based I/O

🕹 How the Game Works

Program selects a random word

User sees blanks

User guesses letters

Correct guesses → revealed

Wrong guesses → attempts reduce

Game ends with win or loss message

🚀 How to Run
git clone 🎮 Hangman Game
