🎮 Hangman Game – Project Documentation
🏆 CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship
📌 Task 1 – Word Guessing Game
✨ Introduction

Welcome to the Hangman Game — a simple yet engaging console-based word-guessing project built as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship (10 Dec 2025 – 10 Jan 2026).

The aim of this task was to develop a fun game using only core Python concepts, focusing on logic building and user interaction.

🧠 Project Overview

Hangman is a classic word-guessing challenge where the player uncovers a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. But be careful — you only get 6 wrong attempts before the game ends! 😬

This project highlights:

🧩 Logic building

🎛️ User input handling

🔁 Loops & conditions

🎲 Random module usage

🎯 Objectives

The game achieves the following goals:

🎯 Pick a random word from a predefined list

🕶️ Display the masked format (_ _ _ _)

⌨️ Take letter-by-letter guesses

📝 Track guessed characters

❌ Allow only six wrong attempts

🏆 Detect win or loss

💬 Show meaningful messages to the player

🔧 Technologies Used

Python 3

Built-in Libraries:

random → for word selection

Core Python Concepts:

Strings

Lists

while loops

Conditional logic

Input validation

🎮 Game Flow

Here’s the journey the player takes:

👋 Game starts and welcomes the user

🎲 A random secret word is selected

😶 The user sees empty placeholders (_ _ _ _)

🔡 Player enters guesses

✔️ Correct guess → letter revealed

❌ Incorrect guess → attempts decrease

💥 Game ends when:

All letters are guessed → Victory! 🏆

Attempts reach zero → Game Over 💀

🕵️ The secret word is revealed at the end

⭐ Features

🎲 Random word generation

💬 Clean and simple console interaction

🔒 Prevention of repeated guesses

🛠️ Input validation

🏁 Win/Loss detection

🧠 Beginner-friendly logic flow

🚀 How to Run
Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vatsnandini5-cloud/Hangman-Game

Step 2: Run the Python file
python hangman.py

🔮 Future Improvements

Here are some enhancements planned for future versions:

💡 Add a hint system

📝 Allow full-word guessing

⭐ Introduce scoring

📁 Load words from an external file

🖥️ Build a GUI version (Tkinter / PyQt)

🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully fulfills Task 1 of the CodeAlpha internship.
The Hangman Game strengthens:

🧠 Logical thinking

🛠️ Problem-solving

🐍 Core Python fundamentals

A simple game — but a powerful learning experience!
